# itw-web-app

A redesign concept for In The Works for the Teamwork hackathon in November 2019. Its an entirely seperate frontend, accesing the data from Wordpress using [wpgraphql](https://www.wpgraphql.com/).

Using vue & vue-apollo behind the scenes to query the data.

### 🙏 Things managed I to get done
- Design
- Tooling (as close to the company stack as possible)
- Homepage (without prioritization)
- Single post page (with comment rendering)
- Category Page
- Author Page
- Infinite scrolling (fires early so its seamless)

### 😢Things missing
- [x] ~~Realtime Search (soon)~~
- [x] ~~Auth (works but not enabled yet)~~
- [x] ~~CreateComment mutation~~
- [ ] Like system (less soon)

## 🛠 Project setup ([vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/))
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
