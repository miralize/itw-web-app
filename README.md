# itw-web-app

A redesign concept for In The Works for the Teamwork hackathon in November 2019. Its a entirely seperate frontend, accesing the data from Wordpress using [wpgraphql](https://www.wpgraphql.com/).

Using vue & vue-apollo behind the scenes to query the data.

### Things managed I to get done
- Design
- Homepage (without prioritization)
- Single post page (with comment rendering)
- Category Page
- Author Page

### Things missing 
- [ ] Realtime Search (soon)
- [ ] Auth 
- [ ] CreateComment mutation
- [ ] Like system (less soon)
