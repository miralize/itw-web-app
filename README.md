# itw-web-app

A redesign concept for In The Works for the Teamwork hackathon in November 2019. Its an entirely seperate frontend, accesing the data from Wordpress using [wpgraphql](https://www.wpgraphql.com/).

Using vue & [vue-apollo](https://vue-apollo.netlify.com/) behind the scenes to query the data.

### ðŸ˜Ž Things managed I to get done
- Design (Figma ðŸ™Œ)
- Tooling (as close to the [Teamwork](http://teamwork.com) stack as possible)
- Homepage
- Single post page
- Category Page
- Author Page
- Infinite scrolling (fires early so its seamless)

### ðŸ¥º Things missing
- [x] ~~Realtime Search~~
- [x] ~~Auth (not enabled yet)~~
- [x] ~~CreateComment mutation~~
- [ ] Like system (less soon)

## ðŸ›  Project setup ([vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/))
```
npm install
npm run serve
```
